== Runnning

If you only want to try the application without modifying it, run the build and start the components with `docker-compose`.

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package
docker-compose up
----

When all components are up browse to http://localhost:8080.


* Do one time build to pull the dependencies `mvn clean install`
